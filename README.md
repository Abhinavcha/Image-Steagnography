# Image-Steagnography
Nowadays multimedia messages have become the backbone of communication over internet so security of data is must before transmission of data over network. 
This project presents hybrid approach of securing image i.e., combining image segmentation and steganography. Firstly, the image will be divided into blocks using 
some segmentation algorithm which is then hided into cover image using steganography. Experimental results of projects are also attached. 
Here segmentation of data is used and then steganography is used for hiding the segmented data in carrier file of some type like image, providing 2 level of security. 
This project intends to work on splitting and merging of image combined with steganography, its uses and techniques.
